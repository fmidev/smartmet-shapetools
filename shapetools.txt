\mainpage shapetools - A collection of ESRI shapefile tools.

\section rendering Rendering shapefiles

\ref shape2ps is a program that takes as input a file containing
a mixture of PostScript tokens and shape2ps tokens controlling
shapefile polygons, and produces a rendered shapefile.

\section amalgamation Amalgamation

Amalgamation is the process of combining multiple adjacent or nearby
polygons into one bigger one. This is used for example to combine
many little islands into one larger one. This is especially important
when rendering the archipelago due to the very large number of
polygons present - drawing the outlines with black would cause
the archipelago to look black. On the other hand removing all small
polygons would make the archipelago look too empty.

The approach taken for amalgamation in shapetools is to perform
constrained Delaunay triangulation on the input polygons. Then
any polygon which is not a part of the input polygons is accepted
as long as the sides are short enough. The sides can be short only
if there are nearby polygons, or if the features (bays mainly) of
the original polygon are small enough.

From the accepted triangles one can then simply build new larger
polygons by combining adjacent triangles.

The commands used in the process are given below in the order
they are typically applied.

\subsection phase1 shape2triangle
\ref shape2triangle is a program to convert ESRI shapefiles into
the PSLG format suitable for constrained Delaunay triangulation
by Jonathan R. Shewchuk's Delaunay triangulation programs. Particular
care is taken to label each polygon uniquely so that we can identify
triangles which are inside the original polygons later on. An optional
area limit can be used to remove small islands from consideration.

For example,
\code
shape2triangle 5 /var/www/share/shapes/DCW/Suomi/ponet suomi
\endcode
performs the conversion, and removes all polygons smaller than
5 km2 from the output.

\subsection phase2 triangle
This phase performs the constrained triangulation, for example
\code
triangle -pcAI suomi
\endcode
Note that all 4 options are important, and must be used.

\subsection phase3 amalgamate
\ref amalgamate is a program to perform the actual amalgamation
on the given PSLG files with the given area and length limitations.
The area limit is optional, it is used to prevent too small polygons
from appearing in the output. Note that typically the area limit
used in this phase may be much larger than in the previous
\ref triangle2shape phase.

For example,
\code
amalgamate 4 100 suomi suomi.1
\endcode
will connect all islands nearer than 4 km to each other, but
will remove all polygons smaller than 100 km2 from the output.
The output name contains intentionally the suffix .1 for the
next phase \ref phase4.

\subsection phase4 triangleshow
triangleshow is part of Shewchuk's package, we have just renamed
the original showme command to be a bit more descriptive of the
origins. triangleshow is a program to visualize PSLG files, including
the triangulations.

For example, to visualize the results of the previous phases
we would use
\code
triangleshow suomi
\endcode

\subsection phase5 triangle2shape
\ref triangle2shape is a program to build a shapefile from the
given PSLG files. An optional area limit can again be used to
remove too small polygons, although one is more likely to use
the option already in the \ref amalgamate phase.

For example, since we already used an area limit in the amalgamation
phase, we would simply use
\code
triangle2shape 0 suomi.1 suomishape
\endcode
to obtain suomishape.shp etc files. The files can then be used
for example by \ref shape2ps for rendering purposes
